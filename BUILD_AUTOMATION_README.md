# KLayout Windows Build Automation

A robust, automated Windows build solution for the KLayout electronic design automation (EDA) application. This project provides a production-ready batch script that streamlines the complex process of building KLayout on Windows with Qt and MSVC toolchain.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This build automation solution was developed to address the challenges of building KLayout on Windows, where multiple dependencies (Qt, zlib, MSVC toolchain) need to be correctly configured and integrated. The script provides a reliable, reproducible build process with comprehensive error handling and verification.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Pre-configured Environment
- **Qt Integration**: Configured for Qt 6.5.3 MSVC2019 64-bit
- **Zlib Support**: Utilizes vcpkg-managed zlib installation
- **KLayout Bits**: Integrated with klayout-bits dependency package
- **MSVC Toolchain**: Visual Studio 2022 BuildTools compatibility

### Smart Verification System
- **Dependency Checks**: Validates all required components before build
- **Fail-Fast Approach**: Stops immediately if any dependency is missing
- **Environment Validation**: Ensures MSVC environment is properly configured
- **Path Verification**: Confirms Qt qmake, zlib headers/libraries accessibility

### Robust Build Process
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All output captured to `build_log.txt`
- **Clean Build Environment**: Removes previous build artifacts
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting and recovery suggestions
- **Success Verification**: Automatically validates build completion

### Production-Ready Features
- **Build Artifact Verification**: Checks for 19 expected KLayout DLL files
- **User-Friendly Feedback**: Clear status messages throughout process
- **Reproducible Builds**: Consistent environment setup every time
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive usage instructions and troubleshooting

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Visual Studio 2022 BuildTools** (or Visual Studio 2022)
- **Qt 6.5.3 MSVC2019 64-bit** installed in `C:\Qt3\6.5.3\msvc2019_64`
- **vcpkg** with zlib installed: `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows`
- **KLayout Bits** package in `c:\klayout-bits`

### Installation Commands
```batch
# Install vcpkg and zlib
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git C:\vcpkg
cd C:\vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg install zlib:x64-windows

# Download KLayout bits (adjust URL as needed)
# Extract to c:\klayout-bits
```

## üîß Usage

### Basic Build
```batch
# From Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt
cd D:\Afzaal\C-Python\klayout-master\klayout-master
.\build_klayout.bat
```

### Verification
The script automatically:
1. Checks all dependencies
2. Sets up MSVC environment
3. Configures include/library paths
4. Executes build process
5. Verifies successful completion

### Output
- **Success**: Lists all generated KLayout DLL files
- **Failure**: Provides detailed error information and suggestions
- **Logs**: Complete build log in `build_log.txt`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Build Process
1. **Environment Setup**: Initializes MSVC 2017 x64 environment
2. **Dependency Verification**: Validates Qt, zlib, and KLayout bits
3. **Path Configuration**: Sets INCLUDE/LIB environment variables
4. **Clean Build**: Removes previous artifacts for fresh build
5. **Compilation**: Executes KLayout build with optimized settings
6. **Verification**: Confirms successful DLL generation

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Pre-flight Checks**: Comprehensive dependency validation
- **Environment Validation**: MSVC toolchain verification
- **Build Monitoring**: Real-time error detection
- **Post-build Verification**: Artifact validation
- **Recovery Guidance**: Specific error resolution steps

## üéØ Use Cases

### Development
- Local KLayout development and testing
- Dependency management demonstration
- Build process optimization

### Professional/Interview Context
- Showcasing build automation expertise
- Demonstrating Windows C++ development skills
- Illustrating error handling and process automation
- Production-ready script design principles

### CI/CD Integration
- Foundation for automated build pipelines
- Template for Windows-based build automation
- Integration with version control workflows

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Qt Not Found**: Verify Qt installation path in script
2. **Zlib Missing**: Ensure vcpkg zlib installation
3. **MSVC Environment**: Run from VS Developer Command Prompt
4. **Permissions**: Run as Administrator if needed

### Debug Information
- Check `build_log.txt` for detailed build output
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure all dependency paths are accessible
